    <div class="aboutContent">
        <p>My name is Fernando Fares, and I am a civil engineer graduated from UFC (Federal University of Cear√°). My professional journey began in the commercial area, but during my last job, I discovered my passion for software development through an internal course. I completed the course with distinction and was promoted to the development team.</p>
        <p>Initially, I worked on data automation and processing using Python, which facilitated my transition to the technology field. Soon after, I joined the development team and received training in C++, C#, and SQL. Since then, I have been working on the development and maintenance of REST APIs, software, web solutions, databases, and third-party system integrations.</p>
        <p>Throughout my journey, I have focused on continuously improving the quality of my code, ensuring it is clean, optimized, and well-organized, adhering to best practices, design patterns, and business requirements. Currently, I am seeking to enhance my technical skills, expand my network, and achieve a higher level of seniority. My goal is to contribute to the team by leveraging my experience to develop high-performance, scalable, and maintainable solutions.</p>
